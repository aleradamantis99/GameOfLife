# GameOfLife
### Implementation of the Game of Life using C++ and SFML.

## Compilation

You only need to type the command `make` in order to compile the program. The executable is called **GOL**

## SFML Versi√≥n

The program runs in normal SFML by default. Passing any argument at execution activates stepped mode, where you need to press space if you want to continue to the next round
